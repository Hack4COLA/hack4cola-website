## Usage

1. Add the project's `name` and the `URL` of its GitHub repository, Trello group, Google Doc, or wherever the latest updates are publicly available. Use Markdown format for links, like `[Project Name](https://github.com/your-repo-here)`
2. Add a `description` of the project.
3. Add the `data used` info - the County datasets used in this project.
4. Add a `contact` place, person, or group for the project.

<!--
2. Add a `status`. Suggestions: `brainstorming`, `organizing`, `wireframing`, `getting data`, `cleaning data`, `testing`, `working on front-end`, `working on back-end`, `testing`.
2. Add a `type`: Is it a static app, where the data does not change, or does the app store data and the data change dynamically? Is it a tool like an API or scraper? Is it a data set? Is it a mobile app or desktop app or both?
3. Add a `contact` place or person, like an `@`name for someone's name on Slack or `#`name for a channel group on Slack.
4. Add the current `needs` for your project so people know how to contribute.
